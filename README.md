Updated the title tag and linked the css style sheet to the html 
created the h1 tag for the header
created a nav bar on the left hand side using 'ul' and populated it with About me, Projects, and contact me
Created the footer with the h3 tag
Added 3 articles with sections inside of them each with their own headers 
started the css sheet with the body and made the font and color of the background and the size of the padding on all sides of the H1
I gave background colors to all the sections of the page to make it easier to see when Iam editing the page
