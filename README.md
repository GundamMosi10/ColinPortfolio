# Colin's Portfolio



## Description:

    This application is a one-page front end webpage about myself and the applications that I have made during my career. This is a project for myself to show what I can do to potential employers and to share my code with the rest of the world and ask for feedback on what I have done. Through working on this portfolio I realized how much I like working through code and testing what I have, figuring out solutions that pop up during the process of writing code. I will continue updating this site to meet my standards as I learn more and gradually it will become a more fluid cohesive and responsive presence on the web.
