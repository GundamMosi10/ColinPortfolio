Updated the title tag and linked the css style sheet to the html 
created the h1 tag for the header
created a nav bar on the left hand side using 'ul' and populated it with About me, Projects, Contact me, and Resume
made the aside bar and figured I would put the nav bar inside of that
created the footer with the h3 tag
Added 2 articles with sections inside of them each with their own headers
